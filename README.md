A stylized manga/comic reading list built with CSS Grid and modern CSS features. Each card is colored using a custom --avarage-color variable extracted from the image, influencing shadows, borders, and background tints.

Includes:

Responsive layout using Grid

Sectioned into “Reading”, “Completed”, and “Planning”

Subtle scroll-based animations via view-timeline

Randomized card rotations for a hand-placed look

Font: Troubleside for a soft, printed aesthetic

Perfect for showcasing your current reads or building your own visual backlog tracker.
